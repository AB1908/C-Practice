# C Programming Practice

This repo was created to practice programming in C.

The problems solved are exercises from Kerningham & Ritchie's The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition, affectionately called K&R.
This is in no way a definitive solution guide. It is merely my attempt at practicing C and solving problems that the authors thought relevant.
